## EC Solutions Applicants Code Test
This test is for applicants who seek positions related to web development at EC Solutions, and the requirements are based on technologies that are commonly used in our projects.  It is meant to help us to understand how you cope with these kinds of tasks, and get a feel for how you structure and write code.

### Assignment
Take the provided file `articles.json` and make the data searchable. Simple as that. And no further details will be provided. The rest is up to you.

### Requirements
* The frontend should be written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* Any backend implementation should be written in PHP or JavaScript.
* The solution should function independently of OS (Mac, Windows, Linux).
* Your code should be executable using PHP >= 8.0 and/or Node.js >= 14.
* Your project should be using Git for version control.

### Meriting
* Code structure and documentation.
* Writing code with re-usability in mind.
* An understanding of modern build tools.
* Separation of logic in backend.
* Overall elegance of solution.
* Search matching precision.
* Visual design (UX/UI).

### Things to keep in mind
* Frameworks are allowed, but not endorsed.
* There is a lot of data on each article, use what you see fit.
* If needed, make comments so that we can understand how you reason.

### Submission
When you feel done, please zip up your project, including the git repository, and send it back to the person who you originally received the test from. If you have any questions along the way, please don't hesitate to ask.

And last but not least, this test is **only meant** to take a **few hours** (less than a working day) to complete. 

#### Best of luck!
